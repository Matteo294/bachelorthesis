\section{Experimental evidence for negative temperature}
The existence of negative absolute temperatures was first predicted by Lars Onsager in 1949 \cite{Onsager} in the context of 2D confined turbulence vortices. \\
The confinement of the vortices caused the phase space of the system to be bounded and Onsager showed that this results in a peak of the entropy as a function of the energy, in accordance
to what stated by Ramsey's criteria. \\
The first experimental evidence of negative temperatures was the experiment carried by Purcell and Pound \cite{PandP} in 1951, who managed to bring the spins of a LiF crystal in a negative absolute temperature
state for several minutes.
In this section I want to illustrate the experimental procedure followed by Purcell and Pound to realize such a state.\\
\section{The experiment carried by Purcell and Pound}
The experiment used a system of nuclear spins on a LiF crystal lattice immersed in a uniform magnetic field $\ve h$.
The energy of the system is given by the analogous of equation \ref{eq:Hamiltonian_lattice_spin}
\begin{equation*}
    E = - \ve h \cdot \ve M + \mathcal{H}_{ss} + \mathcal{H}_{sl}
\end{equation*}
where $\ve M$ is the magnetic moment vector $\ve M = g \frac{q}{2m} \, \ve S = \mu \, \ve S$, $\ve S$ is the spin and $g$ is the Land√© factor. \\
As before we consider negligible the spin-spin interaction term but still considering it non-zero since it is fundamental to keep the system in internal equilibrium \cite{main_article}. \\
The spin-lattice interaction is characterized by the typical relaxation time $\tau_{L}$ which was found to be around 5 minutes for the considered system. For times much smaller than $\tau_L$, 
the system can be considered as in a transient equilibrium, and the particles' state distribution defines a spin temperature according to equation \ref{eq:spin_temperature}. This temperature is precisely the one
that was deduced to be negative. The effective energy for the system in the experiment is then 
\begin{equation}
    E \approx - \ve h \cdot \ve M
    \label{eq:energy_PandP}
\end{equation}\\
Initially the system was brought into equilibrium aligning all the spins with the magnetic field in either a parallel or antiparallel way: for positive temperatures, for what said in chapter \ref{ch:TLS}, we expect the majority of the spins to be parallel causing the energy given by 
equation \ref{eq:energy_PandP} to be negative. \\
Then, suddently, the magnetic field was switched in direction, causing the majority of the spins to be antiparallel to the magnetic field, hence giving raise to a positive energy. This state is characterized by a negative spin temperature.
Figure \ref{fig:PandP_switch} illustrates schematically the states before and after the change in the magnetic field. The temperature is the inverse of the slope of the tangent of the plotted function in the the desired point. \par

    \caption{The figure reports the relation between entropy and energy in a two levels system as found in chapter \ref{ch:TLS}. The system before the experiment was at equilibrium at a positive temperature $T_1$, while after the magnetic field inversion, the system 
    was found to be in an inverted population state described by a negative temperature $T_2$. The temperature is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent of the plotted function in the two points.}

Experimentally it was known that the spins were aligned antiparallel with respect to the magnetic field by looking at the magnetic susceptibility of the system. To define such a quantity, let us first define the magnetization of the system as
\begin{equation}
    M = \sum_i M_i
\end{equation}
where $M_i$ is the projection of the magnetic moment vector $\ve M$ of the i-th particle along the magnetic field axis, or, in other words,
\begin{equation*}
    M_i = \mu \, S_i
\end{equation*}
where $S_i$ is the spin of the i-th particle. \\
The magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ is then defined as the constant such that
\begin{equation*}
    M = \chi \, H
\end{equation*}
A negative susceptibility then implies that the system is in an inverted population state, which means at negative temperatures. The scusceptibility as a function of time in the experiment is reported in figure \ref{fig:PandP_switch}, directly exported from the original article by Purcell and Pound \cite{PandP}.

    \caption{The plot (exported from \cite{PandP}) reports the record of the magnetic susceptibility during the experiment. The first peak denotes
    the initial equilibrium state in which the spins are aligned with the magnetic field in the lowest energy state. As the magnetic field is istantaneously reversed,
    the spins remained aligned in the opposite direction of the field, remaining in the highest enery state and causing the second (negative) peak. After a relaxation time
    $\tau_L$ the spin system returns at equilibrium in the lowest energy state.}
